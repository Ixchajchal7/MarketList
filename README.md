# MarketList

This project was created to do a market list where you can add products, descriptions and price. You can delete them in an easy way plus you can buy all the products. Once you buy all your products the site will be updated to create a new market list. 

You can check the skills applied on this such as HTML, the usage of nodes, CSS, javascript where we added class functionality, local storage as our data. Advanced javascript using getters and setters, the usage of events to create the list.

This project is 90% finished but I will add more updates

Next Updates:

I will add API to see your local exchange rate in real time.
